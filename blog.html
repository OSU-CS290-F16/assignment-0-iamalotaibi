  <li><h3>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h3></li>
  <p1> I didn't find anything challenging more than I have other homework that makes me delay doing this assignment, although I enjoyed every bit of doing it because I had an idea of the whole process before actually starting it.</p1>
  <li><h3>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3></li>
  <p1> I have learned that there is a lot of stuff that we will be learning in this course although the time is limited, so the majority of students, who doesn't have any backround of front-end web development, will have some difficulties because the amount of knowledge that needed to learn within this upcoming 10 weeks.</p1>
  <li><h3>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3></li>
  <p1> I haven't used anything besides this book <i>HTML5 Cookbook</i>. It explains everything in the most simplictic way, which is my way because I am lazy to read a lot. In addition, I had some idea of HTML before because I was preparing myself during summer, which by learning from <i>Codecademy</i>. Finally, I am really excited for this course.</p1>
